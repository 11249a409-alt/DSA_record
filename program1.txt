Aim: To write a C program to implement linear search.

Algorithm:
1. Start.
2. Read the number of elements in the array.
3. Read the elements of the array.
4. Read the element to be searched.
5. Iterate from the first element to the last element of the array.
6. If the element to be searched is found, print the index and break the loop.
7. If the loop completes without finding the element, print that the element is not found.
8. Stop.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[100], n, i, key;

    printf("Enter the number of elements in the array: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("Enter the elements of the array:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    printf("Enter the element to search: ");
    scanf("%d", &key);

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == key) {
            printf("Element found at index %d\n", i);
            break;
        }
    }

    if (i == n) {
        printf("Element not found\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

Output:
Enter the number of elements in the array: 5
Enter the elements of the array:
10 20 30 40 50
Enter the element to search: 30
Element found at index 2

Results: The linear search program was successfully implemented and executed.
